This repository contains the first project for the Relational Database course on FreeCodeCamp.
It includes a `.sql` dump file that can be loaded into a database for practice.
To load the dump file, you can use the MySQL or PostgreSQL command line by `running mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < universe.sql` or `psql -U [username] -d [database_name] -f universe.sql`.
Alternatively, graphical tools can be used to import the file through their respective import options.
